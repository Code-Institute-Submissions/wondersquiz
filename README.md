# User Experience
## Wireframes
In the planning stage I used a wireframe app called [balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) to create the initial design of the website.

## User stories 
### First time user stories
* I want to be able to test my knowledge on both the modern wonders and ancient wonders of the world.
* I want to be able to enter a username and the website respond to my name.
* I want the website to tell me how many questions I got correct and incorrect.

### Returning user stories
* I want the questions to be random every time so I don't know the order and can test my ability to recall the information.

## Design choices
### Colour scheme

### Typography
I have chosen two fonts to use on the website, these are:
* 'Roboto Mono'
* 'Fjalla One'
# Features
## Existing features
## Future features
* I would like to add a scoreboard so users can see who has got the most questions right.
* I would like to add a difficulty section so the users can determine the quiz based on their knowledge.
* I would like to add quizes on other subjects.

# Acessibility
During the creation of the website I have kept accessibility in mind, I have done this by:
* Using semantic HTML.
* Ensuring the colours have sufficent contrast.
* Used a clear font that is easy to read. 

# Testing
## Technologies used
* HTML5 - to build initial content and structure for the website.
* CSS - to add style to the content and website.
* JavaScript - to add interactivity to the website.
* Github - used to deploy the website.
* Gitpod - used to build and edit the website.
